Jams
---

A small Sinatra app for displaying Rdio tracks over a network.

Requires 'rb-appscript' and 'sinatra'.

Run `ruby jams.rb` to start the application.

*This only works on local machines - it interfaces with Rdio through Applescript. Mac only because of Applescript.*


Note: This has been succeeded by my [Sinatra fork](https://github.com/imkmf/now-playing-radiator) of [dsingleton/now-playing-radiator](https://github.com/dsingleton/now-playing-radiator).
